## ðŸ‘‹ Demo

[Demo](https://our-blog-starter.netlify.app/)


## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Install gatsby cli.**

      ```
      npm install -g gatsby-cli 
      ```

2.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
    gatsby new gatsby-blog-starter https://github.com/react-sprint/gatsby-blog-starter-with-typescript
    ```

3.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd gatsby-blog-stater/
    gatsby develop
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `gatsby-blog-stater ` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
